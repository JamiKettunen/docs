```



## Ubuntu/Debian and derivatives

These instructions work for ubuntu focal, ubuntu hirsute, debian bullseye, droidian, ubports, and likely more. We will continue to update this document as the project further develops

### Install Pre-requisites

```bash
sudo apt install curl ca-certificates -y
```

### Install Waydroid

* **Add the repo to your `sources.list`** _(for droidian & ubports, this step can be skipped)_\
Replace `DISTRO="ubuntu-latest"` with your current target. Options: **debian-stable**, **debian-unstable**, **ubuntu-latest**, **ubuntu-rolling**, **ubuntu-devel**

```bash
export DISTRO="ubuntu-latest"

sudo curl -# --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -Sf https://repo.waydro.id/waydroid.gpg --output /usr/share/keyrings/waydroid.gpg && \
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/waydroid.gpg] https://repo.waydro.id/ $DISTRO main" > ~/waydroid.list && \
sudo mv ~/waydroid.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/waydroid.list && \
sudo apt update
```

* **Install waydroid:**

```bash
sudo apt install waydroid -y
```

Then start Waydroid from the applications menu.

## Troubleshooting

### Manually Starting Waydroid

To start Waydroid without systemctl, you need to follow a few simple steps

**Start the container first:**

```bash
sudo waydroid container start
```

**And in a new terminal tab, start the waydroid session (without** _**sudo**_**):**

```bash
waydroid session start
```

After that starts and you see "Android with user 0 is ready", it is safe to launch an app from the applications menu, or

### Launch Waydroid In Full-Screen Mode:

_(This can be run while Waydroid is running, or used to start it in full-screen mode)_

```bash
waydroid show-full-ui
```

### Launch Waydroid In Multi-Window Mode:

First we need to set the property while a Waydroid session is running:

```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.multi_windows true
```

After that, we can restart the container:

```
sudo systemctl restart waydroid-container
```

Then we are ready to launch an app, and it will start in multi-window mode

## Reinstalling Waydroid

Sometimes things don't go as planned and you need to remove it all and start over. To do that, follow the steps below:

First, make sure you have stopped the session and containers:

```bash
waydroid session stop
sudo waydroid container stop
```

Then it is safe to remove Waydroid. For example, on debian or ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt remove waydroid
```

After you removed Waydroid, reboot.

Then once logged back in, we need to do a little cleanup:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/waydroid /home/.waydroid ~/waydroid ~/.share/waydroid ~/.local/share/applications/*aydroid* ~/.local/share/waydroid
```

Then you can follow the install instructions again.
